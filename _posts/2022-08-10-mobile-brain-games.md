You may have heard that puzzles and other brain games sharpen your mind - boosting memory, attention span, thinking speed, creativity, and problem-solving skills.
Many studies have shown that cognitive training via games can improve some of these skills.
(Smith et al., 2009; Mahncke et al., 2006; Ball et al., 2002)

Today, technology has advanced so far that you can practice your cognitive skills through a game app on your smartphone. So why not use it?
Weâ€™re all playing games on our phones anyway - why not play one that can make a real difference in your health?

The world of serious games is not only limited to the design of entertainment and recreational experiences. Serious games are also used with the aim of improving the physical, emotional, and cognitive condition of people.

That's why I am building **[Mobile Brain Games](https://mobilebraingames.com/)**
A collection of mobile apps to train your brain.

The **[first app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=thelouras.pattern.game)**  of mobilebraingames.com is live with over 5k downloads.

More apps are coming soon!

By transforming science-based exercises into games, we make brain training both fun and challenging. Due to the fun gameplay, you won't even realize that you are training. Only ten minutes of brain training a day already improves the cognitive skills that you use every day.
