## Version 1.1.0

Hey there! It's been a while since I've written an update about my **[my android game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=thelouras.pattern.game)**. 
I just wanted to let you know that version 1.1.0 is live now.

I've gotten some great feedback from open & closed beta, and I'm excited about the new features that we've added.\
Here's what's new:

- Difficulty menu: you can now choose how hard or easy the game is for yourself.

- Best time functionality: keep track of your best times!

- Gameplay fixes: thanks to all the amazing feedback from our beta tester, we were able to make some changes to improve gameplay.

- UI/UX improvements: I took your feedback and made some tweaks here and there so that the game is even more attractive.

## Version 1.0.0 Analytics Insight [update 30/07/2022]

I'm so happy to see that my first Android game has hit 1000 #downloads in the first three months.

I'd love to share some analytics with you. It's really interesting how people are playing my game and where they're coming from.

The first thing I want to talk about is engagement time, most of the users play for 3 minutes per session, on average.
The average sessions per user is 2.5 times.
This is a good sign, cause there is not so much content yet.

The second thing I wanted to share was which countries are most active. India is in the top three countries, followed by Greece and United States.Also Pakistan has some good hits.

Finally, let me tell you about organic search, only 7% of users acquired from external referrals, so 93% of the users found the app organically from Google Playstore
