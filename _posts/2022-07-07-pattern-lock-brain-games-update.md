## Version 1.1.0

Hey there! It's been a while since I've written an update about my **[my android game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=thelouras.pattern.game)**. 
I just wanted to let you know that version 1.1.0 is live now.

I've gotten some great feedback from open & closed beta, and I'm excited about the new features that we've added.\
Here's what's new:

- Difficulty menu: you can now choose how hard or easy the game is for yourself.

- Best time functionality: keep track of your best times!

- Gameplay fixes: thanks to all the amazing feedback from our beta tester, we were able to make some changes to improve gameplay.

- UI/UX improvements: I took your feedback and made some tweaks here and there so that the game is even more attractive.
